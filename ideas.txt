ow_weather dict_keys(['main', 'weather', 'clouds', 'wind', 'visibility', 'pop', 'sys', 'dt_txt'])
ocean_weather dict_keys(['timestamp', 'utcOffset', 'surf', 'swells'])

Logic:
enter postcode and data is selected for weather and closest beach,
from openweather.api and surfline scrape saves in dict with key=unix_timestamp.

openweather gives 3 hour intervals of time.

> check if first timestamp is suitable for activity.
>> if not move to next timestampe
>> if it is see if next timestamp is suitable (saving timestamp)
>>> if not disregard
>>> if it is continue until it is unsuitable (or outside of daylight).
>>> return the unix_timestamp period that activity is suitable for

if two activities of the same branch are present. choose the optimal. ('cycling' over 'winter cycling').
